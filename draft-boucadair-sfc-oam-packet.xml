   O bit:  Setting this bit indicates an OAM packet (see [RFC6291]).
      The actual format and processing of SFC OAM packets is outside the
      scope of this specification (for example, see [SFC-OAM-FRAMEWORK]
      for one approach).

      The O bit MUST be set for OAM packets and MUST NOT be set for
      non-OAM packets.  The O bit MUST NOT be modified along the SFP.

      SF/SFF/SFC Proxy/Classifier implementations that do not support
      SFC OAM procedures SHOULD discard packets with O bit set, but MAY
      support a configurable parameter to enable forwarding received SFC
      OAM packets unmodified to the next element in the chain.
      Forwarding OAM packets unmodified by SFC elements that do not
      support SFC OAM procedures may be acceptable for a subset of OAM
      functions, but it can result in unexpected outcomes for others;
      thus, it is recommended to analyze the impact of forwarding an OAM
      packet for all OAM functions prior to enabling this behavior.  The
      configurable parameter MUST be disabled by default.

      <t><list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="O bit:">Setting this bit indicates an SFC OAM packet.
          Such a packet is any NSH-encapsulated packet that exclusively
          includes OAM data. An OAM data can be included in the Fixed-Length
          Context Header, optional Context Headers, and/or the inner packet.
          <vspace blankLines="1" />The O bit is typically set by an OAM
          controller or a final destination of an SFC OAM packet that triggers
          a response (e.g., a specific SFC-aware SF, the last SFF of an SFP).
          <vspace blankLines="1" />The O bit MUST be set for SFC OAM packets
          and MUST NOT be set for non-OAM packets. The O bit MUST NOT be
          modified along the SFP.<vspace blankLines="1" />NSH-encapsulated
          packets that include user data are not considered as SFC OAM packets
          even if some OAM data (e.g., record route) is also supplied in the
          packet. <vspace blankLines="1" />When an OAM data is included in the
          inner packet, the Next Protocol field is set to reflect the
          structure of that inner OAM packet. The setting and processing of
          the O bit neither assumes nor expects detailed analysis of the
          content of any inner IP packet carried by the NSH. As such, SFFs,
          SFC-aware SFs, and SFC Proxies SHOULD discard any NSH packets with
          the O bit set and Next Protocol set to something that is not itself
          an OAM protocol. This includes discarding the packet when the O bit
          is set and the Next Protocol is set to 0x01 (IPv4), 0x02 (IPv6),
          0x03 (MPLS), or 0x05 (Ethernet).<vspace blankLines="1" />An SFC OAM
          packet MAY include optional Context Headers (e.g., a subscriber
          identifier <xref target="RFC8979"></xref> or a flow identifier <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh-tlv"></xref>) that are used to influence
          the processing of the packet by SFC data plane elements. <vspace
          blankLines="1" />An SFC OAM packet MAY include OAM data in both
          Context Headers and the inner packet. The processing (including the
          order) of the OAM data SHOULD be specified in the relevant OAM or
          Context Header specification. <vspace blankLines="1" />SFC-aware
          SF/SFF/SFC Proxy/Classifier implementations that do not support SFC
          OAM procedures SHOULD discard packets with O bit set, but MAY
          support a configurable parameter to enable forwarding received SFC
          OAM packets unmodified to the next element in the chain. Forwarding
          SFC OAM packets unmodified by SFC elements that do not support SFC
          OAM procedures may be acceptable for a subset of OAM functions, but
          it can result in unexpected outcomes for others; thus, it is
          recommended to analyze the impact of forwarding an SFC OAM packet
          for all OAM functions prior to enabling this behavior. The
          configurable parameter MUST be disabled by default. <vspace
          blankLines="1" />The actual format and additional processing of SFC
          OAM packets is outside the scope of this specification.</t>
